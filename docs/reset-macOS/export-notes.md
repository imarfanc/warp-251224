Yes — there **are tools and methods similar in spirit to “iMessage-Exporter” but
for Apple Notes**, though Apple’s Notes app doesn’t offer a built-in bulk export
tool the way iMessage-Exporter does for messages. Here are the best options
depending on what you want to do: ([Apple Support][1])

## 🛠️ **Dedicated Export Tools for Apple Notes**

### 📄 **Exporter (Mac app)**

- A third-party Mac application (called **Exporter**) that can export all your
  Apple Notes to **Markdown or HTML** files in bulk.
- This gives you a format that’s easier to archive or bring into other apps like
  Obsidian or Notion.
- Works by granting the app access to your Notes on macOS. ([App Store][2])

> This is probably the closest analog to something like _iMessage-Exporter_ but
> specifically for Notes.

---

## 💻 **Other Tools & Scripts**

### 📌 **Notes-Exporter (GitHub project)**

- A script/tool that extracts Apple Notes into **HTML, Markdown, plain text,
  PDF, and even Word (DOCX)** with attachments preserved.
- You run it on a Mac where you have access to the Apple Notes data.
- Very useful for creating a **archivable or importable dataset**. ([GitHub][3])

---

## 📱 **Device Backup Browsers**

### 📁 **iMazing (Windows/Mac)**

- A general iOS data management app that also lets you **export multiple Notes
  to PDF or text** from a device backup.
- Not Note-specific like Exporter, but good if you want to pull data off an
  iPhone without using macOS Notes app directly. ([iMazing][4])

---

## 📲 **Manual or Built-In Options (Limited)**

### 📝 **Apple Notes Built-In Export**

- On a **Mac**, you can export individual notes one-by-one as PDF or Markdown
  via **File → Export As…**, but **there’s no official bulk option built in**.
  ([Apple Support][1])

### 📂 **Drag-and-Drop on iPad**

- On modern iPadOS, you can sometimes select multiple notes and drag them into
  Files as `.rtfd` bundles — not a pure export app but handy for batches.

## 📥 **Migrating to Other Apps (Extra Option)**

If your goal is **export + reuse in another note app**, some apps support direct
imports:

- **Obsidian** has an Apple Notes **Importer Plugin** that pulls Apple Notes
  into Markdown vault folders. ([Obsidian Help][6])
- Alternatively, you could export notes to Markdown/HTML via Exporter or
  Notes-Exporter and then import into apps like Notion, Joplin, or Bear.

## 🧠 Summary & Best Picks

**Best one-click export style tools**

  PDF. ([GitHub][3])

whether you want **bulk export** or **conversion into a particular format
(Markdown, PDF, Word, etc.)**, I can tailor specific tool recommendations and
